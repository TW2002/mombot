PSCAN - Sends Planet Data Over SubSpace. 

   pscan {Planet #} 

   [Planet #] - Is optional. However if left out you must
                start it from Citadel,  or Planet command
                and current planet will be displayed.  If
                a Planet Number is specified, that planet
                will be  displayed assuming  it's in the 
                current sector.
